# 🔐 Solidify - Web3 Smart Contract Security Auditor

Catch vulnerabilities before attackers do.

Solidify is an AI-powered smart contract security auditor built for Web3 developers. Paste Solidity code, upload a .sol file, or scan any live on-chain contract — and get back a structured threat report with plain-English explanations, severity scores, and AI-generated secure patches.

Built at GDG Abuja × Build with AI Sprint Hackathon by Team Solidify.
Part of the TCP (The Coding Peace) ecosystem — Ghost hunts Web2, Solidify hunts Web3.

## 🚨 The Problem

Millions of dollars are lost every year to preventable smart contract exploits. Traditional manual security auditing is expensive, slow, and inaccessible to early-stage Web3 projects and independent developers. Most emerging developers deploy contracts without any security review at all.

Solidify is the first line of defense every Web3 developer deserves.

## ✅ What Solidify Does

- 🔍 Scans Solidity contracts for known vulnerability patterns
- 🧠 Explains every risk in plain English — no security background required
- 🎯 Scores findings by severity: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
- 🩹 Patches vulnerabilities with AI-generated secure code replacements
- 📄 Exports a professional PDF audit report with one click
- 🌐 Scans live contracts directly from a blockchain address

---

## 🎯 Three Input Modes

| Mode | How | What You Get |
|------|-----|--------------|
| **Paste Code** | Drop Solidity into the editor | Instant audit + patch side-by-side |
| **Upload File** | Drag & drop .sol file | Full structured audit + PDF export |
| **On-Chain Scan** | Enter contract address | Fetch → audit → report from live chain |

| 03 | Side-by-Side Patch Generation | For every vuln, returns original vulnerable snippet AND corrected secure replacement. |
| 04 | File Upload Audit (.sol) | Drag-and-drop .sol file. Backend extracts source and passes through audit engine. |
| 05 | On-Chain Contract Scan (Etherscan) | Input contract address → fetches verified source from Etherscan API → audits live contract. |
| 06 | PDF Audit Report Export | One-click PDF export with cover page, executive summary, vulnerability table, code diffs. |
